# Welcome to tkoar's Game of Life

This game was built using the React.js framework.

There are three buttons and an input box available for controlling the game.
  * Press the 'Start' button to start the game.
  * Press the 'Pause' button to stop the game.
  * Press the 'Resume' button to start the game after pausing.
  * Press the 'Reset' button to clear the board and start a new game. A new game will only start after pressing 'Start'.
  * The 'Interval' input box allows the player to control how quickly turns take place. The minimum speed is 50 milliseconds.
  * To update the interval speed, press the 'Update Interval' button.

Happy Playing!

**Opening issues and pull requests to improve the game are happily accepted!**
